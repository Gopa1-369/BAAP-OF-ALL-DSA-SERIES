// Predict the output of the following code snippet:


int main(){
    int x=5;
   
    cout << x++ << " " <<++x;
}
 
 //x++ 
       //intialy x value is 5
       //in x++ x means x is assign with 5   out:x=5
       //then ++ increase x value   out:x=6
       // finally    x++  -> 6

// ++x
      // performing x++ so x value is x=6;
      //++ increse x value  out:x=7
      //x means x is assign with 7  out:x=6

//final output is: 6 7
