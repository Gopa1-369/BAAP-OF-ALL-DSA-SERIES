       >>>>>>>>  Intro to if else <<<<<<

   // there is crush with you want to go for date
   // you go to her and ask for go to date
   //if she reply yes so you go to date
   //if she reply no so you not go to date

   //when you go to crush her respond either yes or no based on date decide  so it's called condition(yes or no)

   //same condition rule apply in programming
      there is condition based on code execute

 //syntax of condition(if else)
   if(condition){
      // condition true so if{}  code execute
   }else{
      // condition false so else{} code execute

   }


        >>>>>>>> Multiple condition using && and || <<<<<<<<<<

   ex:// take positive integer input and tell if it is a three-digit number or not

int main(){
    int a;
    cout <<"Enter the number: ";
    cin >> a;
  
  //here multiple conditon take and both true then if blok is print
    if(a>=100 && a<=999){
        cout <<"The number is Three digit number";
    }else{
   
    }
      
}


                 >>>>>>>> NESTED IF ELSE <<<<<<<<<<<

if(){
   if(){
      if(){

      }else{

      }

   }else{

   }
