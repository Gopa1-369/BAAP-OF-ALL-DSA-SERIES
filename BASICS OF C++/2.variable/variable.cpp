//beacus char can only store integer values (0-255 in ASCII)
// 8.5 is a floating-point number (decimal).
// char e = 8.5; â†’ The .5 part is truncated (ignored), and only 8 is stored.
// ASCII 8 is a non-printable control character (Backspace)
// char e = 8.5; stores 8, which is the Backspace (\b) character in ASCII.
// When cout << e; executes, it erases the previous character (B from d), making it seem like d never printed.
// Backspace (\b) removes the last printed character from the console.

//solution: Use only printable ASCII values (32-126) for visible output
